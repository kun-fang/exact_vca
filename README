This is a FORTRAN code for variational cluster approximation (VCA).
The exact diagonalization method is used as cluster solver. The code
is used as-is, meaning there is no support for the code. I will update
it when I would like to. Some routines are from online sources.

update 1:
-- change input format for further expansion

The original version:

-- simple implimentation for VCA.
-- work properly when the quantum state is symmetric when reverse the
   spin direction.
-- no spin up and spin down coupling.
-- good for invesigate AF, Nematic and some other effects.
